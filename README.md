# Computer Architecture Project: MIPS Processor Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a simulation for the MIPS processor architecture and its various components. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the internal workings of the MIPS architecture, including its instruction set, pipeline stages, and memory hierarchy.

## Repository Structure

- **AR2_6.pro**: Project configuration file.
  
- **Decode.h, EXE.h, Memory.h, Print.h, Pulse_refresh.h, control_unit.h, firstHeader.h, input.h, load_fetch.h, run_all.h, widget.cpp, widget.h**: Core files related to the simulation of the MIPS processor components.

- **widget.ui**: User interface file for the simulation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the repository directory.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the respective files to set up the environment and run the simulation.
